# LC-Modlist-Installer
This is a Lethal Company modlist installer for my *tech savvy* members of the Refugees discord ;p

Note: the exe deletes all plugins inside of your plugins folder to ensure nothing old is left behind, **you have been warned**

## How to use exe
Run <br /> 
find Lethal Company root folder <br /> 
ENSURE that your install path reads `<steamDIR>steamapps/common/Lethal Company` and not `<steamDIR>steamapps/common/Lethal Company/Lethal Company` <br /> 
Profit <br /> 

## How to install w/ zip (for first time install)
Goto `<steamDIR>/steamapps/common/Lethal Company` <br /> 
Extract the contents of `lcmod(v?).zip` to `<steamDIR>/steamapps/common/Lethal Company` <br /> 
Done. <br /> 

## How-to-install (for second+ time install) <br /> 
Follow steps above <br /> 
Remove any mods that were replaced/removed in the change log <br /> 
Done <br />
