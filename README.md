# LC-Modlist-Installer
This is a Lethal Company modlist installer for my *tech savvy* members of the Refugees discord ;p

Note: the exe deletes all plugins inside of your plugins folder to ensure nothing old is left behind, ** you have been warned**

## How to use exe
Run
find Lethal Company root folder
ENSURE that your install path reads `<steamDIR>steamapps/common/Lethal Company` and not `<steamDIR>steamapps/common/Lethal Company/Lethal Company`
Profit

## How to install w/ zip (for first time install)
Goto `<steamDIR>/steamapps/common/Lethal Company`
Extract the contents of `lcmod(v?).zip` to `<steamDIR>/steamapps/common/Lethal Company`
Done. 

## How-to-install (for second+ time install)
Follow steps above
Remove any mods that were replaced/removed in the change log
Done
